## Block Development Workflow

Source code is located in the `src` folder. Run `npm install` to install all of the required modules.

When making changes to the block:

* Run `npm start` to build a development version with file watching.
* Run `npm run build` to build a minified production file.

For more details, see [ahmadawais/create-guten-block](https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block) which is the project that this plugin uses to manage block building.
